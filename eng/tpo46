The passage claims storing patients' medical records in electronic forms should beat writing them on paper forms, because the former is of lower costs, less errors and can assist research. However, the professor from the lecture disapproves of all the three advantages.

First, the passage claims that storing medical records in electronic forms can decrease costs for it save storage space. However,  the woman points out that the reduce is not large due to that most doctors still keep paper records besides electronic ones. So they have to pay for storage space for papers as well. 

Second, the passge states that electronic records are important to decreasing the medical errors.  However, the woman argues most doctors keep the habit of taking notes, which are recording into computers later by the staff. And the illegible handwriting may still be misinterpretted by doctors' collegues.

Last, the passge claims electronic records is helpful to research for a huge number of medical data can be accessed by from anywhere. But the woman argues it is inconvenient and difficult to use such data. The privacy law strictly limits the access to the medical data. And researchers has to ask for many permissions. Patients can block the researchers' requests.
